                    <p>The Local Governance Regional Resource Center (LGRRC) is a mechanism that helps DILG IV-A (CALABARZON) to become a knowledge-centric organization insofar as the promotion of excellence in local governance is concerned. Said strategy harmonizes the initiatives of all stakeholders of local governance in the region by leveraging convergence and knowledge management. </p>
                    <p>Moreover, the LGRRC is supported by the Multi-Sectoral Advisory Committee (MSAC) composed of different NGAs, LRIs, CSOs, and Private Sector representatives. It performs the following support functions: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Recommend general direction and guidance in the operationalization of the LGRC;</li>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Contribute knowledge products; </li>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Make accessible and available the knowledge products to users; </li>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Contribute to the development of best practices and its replication;</li>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Identify areas of convergence among stakeholders; </li>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Periodic review of Knowledge Management; </li>
                        <li style="margin-left:30px;">Monitor and evaluate the impact of LGRC and the attainment of its vision, mission, and goals</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>LGRRCâ€“MSAC partnership is legally bound by a Memorandum of Agreement (MOA) or a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) between the DILG and other partner members to ensure the commitment and sustainability of various collaboration efforts. This sustained partnership aims to effectively and efficiently implement programs and projects that enhance LGU capacity through the sharing of knowledge, learning, and experience as well as the replication of good practices in local government. </p>
                    <p>LGRRC-MSAC encourages the expansion of membership to include the private and business sector, industries, foundations, chamber of commerce, and international organizations.

                        LGRRC IV-A inspires others to establish sub-LGRRC facilities in the academic institutions and local government offices within the CALABARZON Region. The sub-LGRRC facility serves as an avenue to promote knowledge sharing, greater accessibility, and wider reach to the public.
